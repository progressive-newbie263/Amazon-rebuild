Overall this is the biggest js project i have learnt so far (July 14th, 2024) through Mr SuperSimpleDev's JS full course on YT. 

From his code frame, With a few adjustments, i made this frontend website. There are still a few errors in this website, such as the quantity selector

I'll learn and update it more in the future. In the mean time, i am kinda proud of this xD
